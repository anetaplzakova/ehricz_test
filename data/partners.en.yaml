   The National Archives is an administrative authority and the central archive of the Czech Republic directly managed by the Ministry of the Interior.

    The archive was established in 1954 by incorporating the Archives of the Czech Lands and the Central Agricultural and Forestry Archives into the Central Archives of the Ministry of the Interior. However, the tradition of the institution can be traced back to the distant past. The newly established archive became a scientific research institute, which was entrusted with the professional care of the archival holdings (collections), especially of central authorities, bodies and institutions.

    Today, the main essence of the National Archives' research programme is a combination of basic and applied research. It carries out scientific and research activities in the field of archival science, auxiliary historical sciences, historiography and related scientific fields, and performs the tasks of a central scientific and research workplace in the field of preventive care of archival materials, preservation and restoration of archival materials, as well as in the field of preservation and access to new forms of information media, including documents in digital form.
