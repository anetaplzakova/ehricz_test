    ensuring that its wealth of materials is put at the service of the future. The Wiener Holocaust Library aims to engage people of all ages and backgrounds in
    understanding the Holocaust and its historical context through an active educational programme and by communicating the accessibility, power and contemporary
    relevance of its collections as a national resource for those wishing to prevent possible future genocides.
