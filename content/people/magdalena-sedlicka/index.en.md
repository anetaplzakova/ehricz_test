Her research focuses on modern Jewish history in the Czech lands, the Holocaust, oral history, and digital editions. In 2021, she published the book Not All Friends Are Alike: Jews in the Nation State of Czechs and Slovaks, 1945-1948. She is also one of the lead editors of EHRI's digital editions Early Holocaust Testimony (2020) and Documentation Campaign (2023), which focus on early postwar testimonies about the Holocaust.
