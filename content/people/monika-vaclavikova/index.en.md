Mgr. Monika Václavíková (*1972, née Sedláková) is a professional archivist at the National Archives in Prague. In 1998 she graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy and Natural Sciences of the Silesian University in Opava, majoring in history. Her main interest is the history of the Czech lands during the Nazi occupation with a focus on the occupation administration and the Jewish Holocaust.

At the National Archives he specializes in the archival holdings of the German occupation authorities in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. She processed documents of Karl Hermann Frank from the activities of his offices in the Protectorate. Her research in the above-mentioned fonds concerns, among other things, the persecution of Jews in 1939-1945, including the appropriation of their property, and post-war restitution.

In the past, she collaborated on a project of the National Archives supported by the German EVZ Foundation, _Forced Labour of the Czech Population of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia during the Nazi Occupation_, which resulted in a critical edition of documents on the labour deployment of Czechs in the Reich. She is currently involved in the project _The Nazi Occupation Administration in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and its Representatives_, dealing with the top officials of the Office of the Reich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia and the German State Ministry for Bohemia and Moravia, as well as individual Oberlandrats.

Since 2023, when the National Archives became a partner institution of the Czech national node of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI), she has been the coordinator of the _LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ project - Digital Research Infrastructure for Language Technology, Arts and Humanities_, with a focus on EHRI.
