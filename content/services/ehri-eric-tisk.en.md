This follows the decision of the [European Commission (EC)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en) on 20 January 2025 to establish the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure as a [European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC)](https://www.eric-forum.eu/). In doing so, the EC secures EHRI’s future and supports its vision to provide seamless access to all sources and expertise from across Europe and beyond that are relevant to the study of the Holocaust. The EU hereby clearly confirms the relevance of Holocaust research for free and open societies with shared democratic values.

EHRI’s inauguration ceremony will be opened by Hanna Wróblewska, Minister of Culture and National Heritage of Poland, and Władysław Teofil Bartoszewski, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Poland, on behalf of the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Eppo Bruins, Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, will speak on behalf of the hosting country of EHRI-ERIC, the Netherlands.

The Masaryk Institute and Archives of the CAS is a partner institution of the EHRI project and coordinates the Czech national EHRI node, which is part of the research infrastructure LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.
