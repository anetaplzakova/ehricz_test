Have you ever heard about the spa antisemitism? It is a phenomenon that could be encountered in Czech and Moravian spa cities from the end of the 19th century until the 1930s. It appeared mainly on postcards deliberately caricaturing Jewish guests. Antisemitic newspaper cartoons and small statues and sculptures depicting Jews in a stereotypical way were not left out. During her lecture, the art historian **Eva Janáčová** will explain the spa antisemitism and its specific examples. / Free admission.
