The experience of Prague’s Jewish community has long dominated the general history of the Holocaust in the Nazi Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia. The coherent narrative that emerges from that perspective often does not capture the particularly harsh persecution, violent repression, and greater isolation faced by the Jews of Moravia during the first years of the Nazi occupation. American historian Benjamin Frommer will explore the divergent paths of Moravia’s Jews and discuss possible causes for the differences from Bohemia and Prague.  

The lecture is a part of the series organised by the Jewish Museum in Prague and EHRI-CZ “New Views and Sources on the History of Holocaust” to commemorate 80 years since the end of the WWII. 

The lecture will be held in English with simultaneous translation into Czech. The event will be moderated by the historian Magdalena Sedlická from the Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences. 

Entry fee: 60 CZK.
