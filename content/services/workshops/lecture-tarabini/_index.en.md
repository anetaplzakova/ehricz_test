{{< intro >}}
Following the „Judenaktion“ in Denmark in October 1943, 470 Jews were deported to Ghetto Theresienstadt. Other ghetto-prisoners considered the Danes „privileged“ because they received food parcels (from Spring 1944), were visited by the Danish Red Cross, and as a group were exempted from the transports to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In this lecture, however, Terezín will be looked at through the eyes of the Danish prisoners, who despite their relatively privileged position also experienced hardships and suffering.
