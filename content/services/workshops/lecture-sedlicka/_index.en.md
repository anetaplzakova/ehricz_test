On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, the Jewish Museum in Prague, in cooperation with the Czech Node of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI-CZ), prepared a series of lectures entitled New Knowledge and Sources on the History of the Holocaust. The first presentation, entitled Documentation Events in Prague, will be opened by historian **Mgr. Magdalena Sedlická, Ph.D.** (Masaryk Institute and Archives of the CAS, EHRI-CZ). 

The presentation will focus on the digital edition of Shoah survivors' testimonies collected as part of the so-called “Documentation Action in Prague”, one of the earliest projects that focused on collecting authentic documents and evidence of the Shoah, primarily from the territory of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The edition was produced within the framework of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) project, whose platform enables a new way of presenting digital archival content. EHRI digital editions focus on annotated texts supplemented by, among other things, scans of documents and interactive maps.
