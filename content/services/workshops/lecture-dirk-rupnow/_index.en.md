Questions of historical politics and cultures of remembrance are once again in the focus of public attention. After the phase of its globalization and institutionalization, Holocaust memory seems to be subject to a far-reaching process of change. The lecture tries to outline the current status and the current challenges in the European, “Western” and global context. 

This raises questions about the significance of Holocaust remembrance in European migration societies, not least in times when immigration to Europe is perceived as a crisis; and at the same time about the global competitive relationship between the memory of the Holocaust and the memory of crimes of European colonial powers in the world none of which are new questions, but still increasingly relevant and controversial.

The lecture will be held in English, admission is free.
