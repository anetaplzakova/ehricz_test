After the annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, forced labour camps for the Jewish population were set up in many factories owned by local Germans. However, the employment of Czech and German non-Jewish workers continued. In her lecture, Dr. Janine P. Holc will focus on a group of textile factories in the Trutnov region where Polish Jewish girls from Silesia were interned from 1940 until May 1945. Based on the testimonies of survivors and the documents of the perpetrators, you can find out what the relationships between Czech and Jewish workers were like and what strategies the Polish Jewish women used to survive.

The event will be simultaneously interpreted into Czech, admission is free.
