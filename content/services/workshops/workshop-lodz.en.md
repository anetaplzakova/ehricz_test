{{< intro >}}
With the growing interest in Holocaust geographies, researchers, projects and/or educators increasingly work and struggle with data representing the places and spaces of Holocaust history. We invite researchers creating and using geospatial data in the field of Holocaust studies to submit their application for the international EHRI workshop Holocaust Places and Spaces as Data: Challenges and Best Practices. The workshop aims to share experience and discuss practical challenges many projects working with spatial data encounter. At the same time, we want to reflect on broader heuristic, epistemological and ethical issues triggered by turning places into data.
