##### Date: December 4-5, 2024

##### Venue: The National Archives, Archivní 2257/4, Prague 4  

The workshop was part of the Czech EHRI node's long-term effort to rethink priorities and develop new approaches to databases of historical actors. One of the main topics discussed was the introduction of the Arolsen Archives database, which is newly accessible from the National Archives. During the hands-on session, archive staff guided workshop participants through search options and the practical use of the digitized collections.   

The event was organized by the Masaryk Institute and the Archives of the CAS in cooperation with the National Archives. Workshop participants attended presentations on new digital approaches, regional research perspectives, and transnational databases of victims, among other topics. The presentations were concluded by a discussion on the further development and application of data, in the broader context of research on the Holocaust, genocides, and forced migration.
