{{< intro >}}

Top-quality research on the Holocaust is a prerequisite for informed discussion about Czech, European and world modern history and for understanding the risks and mechanisms of racism and genocide in their various forms. The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure](https://www.ehri-project.eu/) (EHRI) connects collections and sources divided by borders and languages, promotes digital methods and supports researchers. The Czech EHRI national node is a gateway to EHRI services and community and a signpost for Holocaust research in the Czech Republic.

## Research infrastructure

The EHRI Czech national node has been part of the research infrastructure [LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ](https://www.lindat.cz/) supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports since 2023. 

EHRI is funded by the European Commission under FP7, Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe.

<!-- FIXME: the formation of ERIC -->
Since 2018, EHRI has been on the roadmap of European research infrastructures and is currently transforming into a permanent organisation - [European Research Infrastructure Consortium](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/european-research-infrastructures/eric_en) (ERIC). The Czech Republic supports this process through the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and is represented in the EHRI Interim General Assembly.

## Main goals and services

 EHRI-CZ provides the following types of services:

- Makes EHRI data and services available, including [EHRI Portal](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/), [EHRI Document Blog](https://blog.ehri-project.eu), [EHRI Editions](https://www.ehri-project.eu/ehri-online-editions), [EHRI Geospatial Repository](https://geodata.ehri-project.eu/), [Conny Kristel Scholarship](https://www.ehri-project.eu/Conny-Kristel-Fellowships_2023), and others.
- Creates data on sources on the history of the Holocaust in the Czech lands and uploads them to the [EHRI Portal](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/).
- Links and enhances the victim databases and methodologically supports their further development.
