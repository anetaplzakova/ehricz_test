{{< intro >}}
The Advisory Board for the Czech node of EHRI has been newly established to provide feedback on the activities and services of EHRI-CZ and to strengthen the connection between the infrastructure and the academic environment. The aim is to explore ways to support academics and students in their work, for example through the use of EHRI online tools.

The board consists of six leading experts in the field of Jewish and Holocaust Studies: Ivana Cahová (Palacký University Olomouc), Michal Frankl (Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe), Benjamin Frommer (Northwestern University), Hana Kubátová (Charles University), Jan Láníček (University of New South Wales, Sydney), and Kateřina Portmann (Technical University of Liberec).

The first meeting took place on September 16 at the premises of the Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The academic advisory board will meet two to three times a year.
