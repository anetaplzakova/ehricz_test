During the week of May 19-23, Mehrin is organizing a series of public discussions with Ann M. Altman Ph.D. entitled **My Moravian Family Heritage**. Ann Altman was born in 1947 in Bristol. Her mother, Edith Löwy, came from Znojmo from the Wotzilko brewing family. Her father, Štěpán Körner, was from Ostrava. Relatives on both sides lived in Třebíč, Brno, Žarošice, Velké Meziříčí and Vienna. While Ann's parents fled Czechoslovakia, all four of her grandparents perished during the Holocaust. Nine discussions for the public and students about Dr. Ann Altman's Jewish roots, the impact of the Holocaust on her family, and her own interesting life will be held in English.

The program will be moderated by the historian Táňa Klementová.
