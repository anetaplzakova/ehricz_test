The conference "White Places of Jewish Moravia and Vienna" will take place on Sunday, April 6, 2025, at MUNI, Komenský náměstí 2. (Sir Roger Scruton Hall)
The MEHRIN museum project together with Masaryk University are organising the conference intended for the general public as well as professional audience. Conference papers concentrate on the connection between Jewish Moravia and Vienna and in turn also on the impact of Vienna and Lower Austria on the life of Moravian Jewish communities. The keynote speaker will be Prof. Dr Christfried Tögel - editor of the complete edition of Sigmund Freud's works. 
 
The conference programme will be simultaneously translated into Czech and German.
