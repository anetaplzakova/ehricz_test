The conference will present the perspectives of researchers from around the world on how the narrative of the Shoah and its image in cultural memory have been transformed since the year 2000 – from new literary forms and the intergenerational transmission of trauma to the ethical questions raised by the depiction of the Holocaust in the age of digital media.
