On the occasion of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the Czech node of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI-CZ), building on the MemoMap Prague project, presents two new interactive maps exploring the fates of the Jewish population during the period of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and beyond. The maps offer a spatial perspective on the processes of exclusion of Jews, the restriction of their everyday contacts with the surrounding society, as well as on contemporary sites of remembrance. Users can explore extensive datasets, including digitised archival documents, photographs, personal stories, commemorative and remembrance events, and specific locations. The development of the applications was also supported by the Foundation for Holocaust Victims (NFOH).

**MemoMap Pacov** documents places connected with the Jewish history of the town during the period of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia. A new feature is the so-called _Story maps_, which allow users to follow individual life stories and trajectories in greater detail. The project was developed in cooperation with the [Tikkun Pacov](https://tikkun.cz/?lang=en "https://tikkun.cz/?lang=en") association. The application is available via the [MemoMap Pacov](https://memomap.cz/pacov "https://memomap.cz/pacov") link.

**MemoMap Říčany** presents the addresses and fates of the town’s Jewish inhabitants, places associated with their lives, and _The Story of the Říčany Torah_. A newly created data layer entitled _Remamberance events_ also provides information on contemporary memorial and remembrance activities. The map was created with the participation of pupils from local primary schools, the Town Hall of Říčany, and the Říčany Museum. The application is available via the [MemoMap Říčany](https://memomap.cz/ricany "https://memomap.cz/ricany") link.

Both applications are fully optimised for mobile devices and can be used directly on site when exploring locations connected with Jewish history.
