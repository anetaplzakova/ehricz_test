The author of the drawings is a Chinese artist Han Jiang Xue, who is living permanently in the Czech Republic. The exhibited drawings were created as a basis for an educational comic book for the Museum of Kroměříž. The comic book traces the imprint of historical events of the 20th century in the life of František Färber, whose family belonged to the Kromeriz Jewish community. The drawings are based on historical sources, such as family photographs, correspondence, and objects gifted to the museum's depository. 
The exhibition opening takes place on Tuesday 8 April at 6 pm. Admission is voluntary.
