We would like to invite you to the lecture by literary scholar **Alexandra Szczepan:** *Intimate Cartographies: Maps as Holocaust Testimonies*.

**Date: 15 January 2026, 6pm**

**Place: Maisel Synagogue, Maiselova 10, Prague 1**

A. Szczepan will show how Holocaust witnesses created and used maps as a means to capture their war experiences and post-war memories. The talk will take a closer look at how Holocaust survivors have created and used maps to give testimony about their experiences both during and after the war. It follows the attempts to document the topography of ghettos and camps by their inmates through handmade plans and models. It asks how maps were used not only as evidence during war crimes trials but also as hiding places, escape routes, points of betrayal or help; to mourn the loss of relatives and to preserve their own memory.

The presentation is part of the lecture series *Current Approaches to Holocaust Research* coorganized by **EHRI-CZ** and the **Jewish Museum Prague**.
