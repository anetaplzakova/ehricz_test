On December 3, 2025, at 3pm, we would like to invite you to join our next EHRI online webinar. The topic will be: _Using Artificial Intelligence to Facilitate the Publication of New EHRI Online Editions_. Maria Dermentzi, a digital humanities specialist at Université Paris-Saclay, will present a new online tool designed to streamline the process of creating digital editions—the EHRI Annotator.

The webinar will demonstrate how EHRI Annotator works: the tool automatically identifies and links key entities (such as camps, ghettos, individuals, etc.) in multilingual documents related to the Holocaust. Participants will have the opportunity to test its features directly on transcripts of archival materials.

EHRI Annotator will become one of the free services offered by the Czech EHRI Node.
