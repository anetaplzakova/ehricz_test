Historian **Hana Kubátová** will present her book _Christian Nationalism, Nation-Building, and the Making of the Holocaust in Slovakia. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2025)_, which explores how the formation of the Slovak national state during World War II was intertwined with collective betrayal and genocide.

**Place: Maisel Synagogue, Maiselova 10, Prague 1**

The author demonstrates that Holocaust in Slovakia was not entirely the result of oppression of the Nazi Germany, but also a process supported by Slovak political and church leaders, local officials, and ordinary citizens.

Hana Kubátová works at the Institute of Political Studies. She has completed long-term research stays at Tel Aviv University in Israel, Heinrich Heine University in Germany, the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Institute for Advanced Study at Central European University in Budapest. She is the author of two other monographs: _Nepokrades!: Nalady a postoje slovenske spolecnosti k zidovske otazce, 1938-1945. Praha: Academia, 2013_ and _The Jew in Czech and Slovak Imagination, 1938–89: Antisemitism, the Holocaust, and Zionism_ (Brill, 2018; co-author Jan Láníček). She is also co-editor of three collected volumes.

The lecture is a part of the series organised by the Jewish Museum in Prague and EHRI-CZ “New Views and Sources on the History of Holocaust” to commemorate 80 years since the end of the WWII.
