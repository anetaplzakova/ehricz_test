**Date: 11th December 2025, 6 pm**

**Place: OVK Auditorium, Maiselova 15, Prague 1, 3rd floor**

Berkyová will address the experiences of Roma and Sinti survivor families across the second and third generations, focusing on their struggles with transgenerational trauma, their efforts to obtain compensation or reclaim confiscated property, and the pursuit of full societal and historical recognition of the genocide of Roma and Sinti. She will also explore how these issues shape contemporary identity, collective memory, and civic activism among individual family members.

**Renata Berkyová** is a PhD candidate in Social History at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University, and a researcher at the Institute for Contemporary History of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Her work focuses on wartime and post-war history in relation to Roma and Sinti communities, with particular attention to issues of compensation, memory politics, and representation.
