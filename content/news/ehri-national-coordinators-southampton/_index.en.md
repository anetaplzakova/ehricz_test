{{< intro >}}
In early November, EHRI’s national coordinators, associates and the Central Hub members assembled for a [National Coordinators Committee](https://www.ehri-project.eu/national-coordinators-committee/) meeting at [The Parkes Institute](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/the-parkes-institute) at the University of Southampton in the UK.
{{< /intro >}}

Each member country of the EHRI-ERIC has a National Node – a consortium of research institutions, archives, museums, libraries and memory institutions with relevant expertise that advances the work of EHRI at the national and transnational level.

These National Nodes are anchored in EHRI-ERIC’s governance through their representation in the National Coordinators Committee which, since its formation in March 2025, meets at least once a year.

On the agenda this time were future funding, the rebranding of the EHRI-ERIC design, guidelines for engaging in projects, 2026 activity plans and the foundation of new working groups.
