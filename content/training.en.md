International access to archives and collections, as well as access to expertise in archives and digital humanities, is essential for a quality Holocaust research. EHRI Conny Kristel Fellowships support and stimulate research conducted by researchers, archivists, librarians, curators, and junior scholars, especially PhD students with limited resources. Funded projects address the Holocaust in its broadest sense, including its prehistory, its consequences, and the role of anti-Semitism before, during, and after World War II.


The Fellowships are funded by the European Union under the rules of the transnational approach and are therefore particularly targeted at applicants working in institutions of the member states (EU-27) and Horizon 2020 associated states. Applications from applicants from Central and Eastern Europe are particularly welcome. It is not possible to apply for research at an institution in the same country where one works.


The fellowships are named after the late historian and first director of EHRI [Conny Kristel](https://www.ehri-project.eu/conny-kristel-26-february-1955-%E2%80%93-6-october-2018).


The current deadline for applications is 22 October 2023.
